## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
One winter night, at half-past nine,  
Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,  
I had come home, too late to dine,  
And supper, with cigars and wine,  
Was waiting in the study.  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table  
Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,  
She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage  
To meet him in the doorway with the news  
And put him on his guard. ‘Silas is back.’  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
"To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  
Because their words had forked no lightning they  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,  
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  

And you, my father, there on the sad height,  
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
