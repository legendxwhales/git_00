## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
One winter night, at half-past nine,  
Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,  
I had come home, too late to dine,  
And supper, with cigars and wine,  
Was waiting in the study.  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table  
Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,  
She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage  
To meet him in the doorway with the news  
And put him on his guard. ‘Silas is back.’  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
